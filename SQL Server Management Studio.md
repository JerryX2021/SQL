In this project, I use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to query the data and perform data analytics.

The Covid-19 data downloaded from the Victorian Department of Health is used. (attached in the Data folder in the main branch)
In SSMS, create a new database named 'CovidCasesByLGA'. Load the downloaded '.csv' data and build a database.

Open a new query in SSMA and use the 'CovidCasesByLGA' for query.
